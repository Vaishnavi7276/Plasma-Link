# Plasma Link

Plasma Link is an online platform designed to connect plasma and blood donors with patients in urgent need of transfusion therapy. The system simplifies the process of locating suitable donors by matching them based on blood group, location, and availability. This initiative aims to bridge the gap between donors and recipients, especially in emergency situations.
